This repo containers an image building sample for building a base image for CodeReady Workspaces/Eclipse Che. The image that gets built creates a user named `user` which is what the image gets "run" under.

This example was adapted from https://github.com/eclipse/che-devfile-registry/tree/master/arbitrary-users-patch.
